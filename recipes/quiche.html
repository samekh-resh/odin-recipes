        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
            turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
            bacon slices on paper towels, then chop coarsely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle bacon, Swiss cheese, and onion into prepared pastry crust.
          </li>

          <li>
            Whisk cream, eggs, salt, sugar, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl;
            pour mixture into pastry shell.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 300
            degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted
            1 inch from the edge comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow quiche to sit 10 minutes before cutting into wedges and
            serving.
